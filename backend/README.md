# Network Topology Chatbot Backend

A Python-based chatbot API that uses Rasa NLU and Core to extract network topology information from user input and provide intelligent responses.

## Features

- **User Greeting**: Responds to user greetings intelligently
- **Network Information Extraction**: Identifies topology type and number of devices using Rasa NLU
- **Rasa-Powered Responses**: Returns dialogue responses generated by your trained Rasa model
- **REST API**: Flask-based API for easy integration
- **Entity Recognition**: Extracts topology and device count from user messages

## Quick Docker Setup

1. Open a terminal and change to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Build the backend image and start the backend container:

```bash
docker-compose build backend
docker-compose up -d backend
```

The Flask backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (it reads trained Rasa models from the `models/` folder shared with the host).

3. Train the Rasa model (runs inside the official Rasa image and writes `models/` to the host):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm -w /app rasa train
```

4. (Optional) Test NLU and dialogue interactively in the Rasa container:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm -w /app rasa shell
```

5. When finished, stop containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## How this works

- The `rasa` service uses the official `rasa/rasa:3.6.0-full` image for training and interactive testing.
- The `backend` service builds from the provided `Dockerfile` and runs the Flask app on port 5000.
- Both services mount the project directory into `/app` so the trained `models/` directory created by the Rasa container is visible to the backend container and the host.

## Example: Send a chat message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I have a star topology with 5 devices"}'
```

Response will be JSON with `success`, `message` (the Rasa response) and `data` containing `topology` and `devices`.
